# burgers
This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Object Relational Mapping to log burgers.  The user is allowed to create any burger they like and its created name will populate on the left-hand side of the screen with a 'devour' button to its right.  If and/or when the user selects the 'devour' button the burger name is moved to the right-hand side of the screen.  A Model View Controller design pattern is followed with Node and MySQL responsible for querying and routing data. Handlebars generates the HTML for the client browser.  <a href="https://eat-the-burger-application.herokuapp.com/index">The app is deployed to Heroku.</a>
